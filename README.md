# ðŸ§® Ridge-Regression-on-Cars

## ðŸ“– Description

This project predicts car prices using Ridge Regression, comparing it to Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) linear regression. Using Python's data science stack (Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib), it explores feature relationships, model performance, and regularization effects on predictions.

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

This project performs:

âœ” Data Cleaning & Preprocessing

âœ” Feature Selection

âœ” Train-Test Split

âœ” Ridge Regression with Cross-Validation

âœ” Comparison with OLS Regression

âœ” Model Evaluation (RÂ², RMSE)

âœ” Visualizations of Predictions

## ðŸ“‚ Dataset
